                1 The earth is the LORD’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;<br>
                2 for he founded it on the seas and established it on the waters. <br>
                3 Who may ascend the mountain of the LORD? Who may stand in his holy place? <br>
                4 The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god. <br>
                5 They will receive blessing from the LORDand vindication from God their Savior. <br>
                6 Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, God of Jacob.

                Psalms 35 <br>
                1 Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me. <br>
                2 Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid. <br>
                3 Brandish spear and javelinagainst those who pursue me. Say to me, “I am your salvation.” <br>
                4 May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay. <br>
                5 May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away; <br>
                6 may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them. <br>
